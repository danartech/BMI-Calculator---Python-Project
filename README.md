# BMI Calculator Project by Dana Robinson

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator using Python. The calculator prompts the user for their weight and height, calculates the BMI, and provides feedback on their BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, etc.).

## Project Structure
- `BMI_Calculator.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Project Details
### Data Input
- Prompts user for their weight (in pounds) and height (in inches).
- Ensures the input is valid and within a reasonable range.

### BMI Calculation
- Calculates BMI using the formula: BMI = (weight in pounds x 703) / (height in inches x height in inches).
- Classifies BMI into categories: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obesity.

### Feedback
- Provides personalized feedback based on the calculated BMI.
- Includes a message indicating the user's BMI category.

## How to Use
1. Download the repository.
2. Open `BMI_Calculator.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells to use the BMI calculator.
